                    <p>Cornerstone Baptist Church is a congregation of Bible believers meeting in Sheboygan, WI. We began meeting in the fall of 2011 and are excited to see God continue to add to His church.</p>
                    <p>We believe the Church is the pillar and ground of the truth. Therefore, our main purpose in getting together is to learn more about the Truth (Jesus Christ) and to encourage each other in our lives and spread the truth of His Gospel to our community and the world.</p>
                    <p>We are a thriving and biblically focused church. We have found God’s Word to be true and are building on its sure foundation. God has added many wonderful people since we started in 2011. Join us for our next worship service and we believe you will be drawn to praise God with us for the great things He has done!</p>
                    <h3 className="aboutTitle2">Statement of Faith</h3>
                    <p>I. THE SCRIPTURES:
                We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be the verbally and plenarily inspired Word of God. The Scriptures are inerrant, infallible and God-breathed and, therefore, are the final authority for faith and life. The sixty-six books of the Old and New Testament are the complete and divine revelation of God to man. The King James Version of the Bible shall be the official and only translation used by the church. (2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1:20-21)</p>
                    <p>II. THE TRUE GOD:
                We believe that there is one, and only one TRUE and living God; that in the Unity of the God-head there are three persons; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. John 4:24</p>
                    <p>III. THE FALL OF MAN:
                We believe that man was created in holiness, but by voluntary transgression, fell from that holy state, in consequence of which all mankind are now sinners and are under the condemnation of eternal ruin. Gen 1:27; Rom 5:12</p>
                    <p>IV. THE WAY OF SALVATION:
                We believe that salvation is the gift of God brought to man by grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, Whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of our sins. (Matt. 12:31-32; John 1:12; Eph. 1:7; 2:8-10;1 Pet. 1:18-19; 1 John 1:9)</p>
                    <p>V. THE FREENESS OF SALVATION:
                We believe that the blessings of the salvation are made free to all by the Gospel, and that nothing prevents the salvation of the greatest sinner but his or her own rejection of the Gospel. Is. 55:1, Jn.3:16</p>
                    <p>VI. REPENTANCE AND FAITH:
                We believe that repentance and faith are inseparable graces, wrought in our soul by regenerating Spirit of God, and are essential steps in salvation. Mark 1:15</p>
                    <p>VII. GOD’S PURPOSE AND ELECTIONS:
                We believe that election is the eternal purpose of God, according to which He graciously regenerates, sanctifies, and saves all sinners who call upon Him for salvation; and that this is consistent with the free agency of man. We reject Calvinism and Arminianism as unscriptural distortions of the Biblical view of Salvation. Rom. 8:28-37, II Peter 1:10-11</p>
                    <p>VIII. SANCTIFICATION:
                We believe that sanctification is a three-fold truth. First, we are positionally sanctified at the point of salvation. Secondly, we are progressively sanctified through the process by which the believer is made partaker of God’s holiness, and that this process begins in regeneration, and that it is carried on the hearts of believers by the presence and power of the Holy Spirit through our obedience to God’s Word unto the image of Christ in us. Finally we will be permanently sanctified when we reach Heaven. (I Thess. 4:3, Phil. 2:12-13 John 6:37-40; 10:27-30; Rom. 8:1; 38-39;1 Cor. 1:4-8; 1 Pet. 1:4-5)</p>
                    <p>IX. A NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH:
                    We believe that the local church, which is the body and the espoused bride of Christ, is solely made up of born-again and baptized persons. (1 Cor. 12:12-14; 2 Cor.11:2; Eph. 1:22-23; 5:25-27)
                    We believe that the establishment and continuance of local churches is clearly taught and defined in the New Testament Scriptures. (Acts 14:27; 20:17, 28-32; 1 Tim. 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-11)
                We believe in the autonomy of the local church free of any external authority or control. (Acts 13:1-4; 15:19-31; 20:28; Rom. 16:1, 4; 1 Cor. 3:9, 16; 5:4-7, 13; 1 Pet. 5:1-4)</p>
                    <p>X. BAPTISM AND THE LORD’S SUPPER:
                We believe that Christ instituted two ordinances to be observed until He returns – Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Baptism, as a symbol of regeneration or new birth and identification with Christ and with a specific form of doctrine, is the immersion of the believer in water in the name of the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit, and the believer’s participation in the death, the burial, and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord’s Supper is a memorial symbolizing the Saviour’s crucified body and His bloodshed for the remission of sins. Matt. 28:19, Acts 8:36-38, Acts 2:41-42, Rom. 6:4-6, Col. 2:12.</p>
                    <p>XI. CIVIL GOVERNMENT:
                We believe that the civil government is of divine appointment, for the interests and good order of human society; and that magistrates are to be prayed for, conscientiously honored and obeyed; except only in things opposed to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ; who is only Lord of the conscience, and the Prince of the Kings of the earth. Rom.13:1-7, Matt. 22:21, Matt. 23:10</p>
                    <p>XII. THE RETURN OF CHRIST:
                We believe in the bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, in His ascension to the Right Hand of God, in His continual intercessory ministry there on our behalf, and in His personal, literal, bodily return from Heaven, first at the pre-tribulational rapture in the air to receive the saints, and Second, at the end of the tribulation, and to set up an earthly millennial Kingdom (1000 Year Reign). Matt.28:1-7; Acts 1:9-11; I Cor. 15:4-7,13, & 20; Rom. 8:34; I Thess.1:7-8; Rev. 19:11-16; Rev. 20:6</p>
                    <p>XIII. JESUS CHRIST:
                We believe that Jesus Christ was begotten by the Holy Spirit; born of a virgin named Mary, and is all God and all man. Matt.1:18; Jn. 1:14,18; Col.2:9; Heb. 2:16-17</p>
                    <p>XIV. CREATION:
                We believe that God created the universe in six literal, 24-hour periods. We reject evolution, the Gap Theory, the Day-Age Theory, and Theistic Evolution as unscriptural theories of origin. (Gen. 1-2; Ex. 20:11)</p>
